<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The project resolves the problem of restaurant owners and customers simultaneously by simplifying the ordering
process, customer service, and management by providing an online platform for both restaurants and customers.
With the recent advent of covid, we are seeing that more restaurants are moving towards an online system for
menu and payment. But sometimes this advancement means slow and complex UI which instead of solving,
increases complexity in ordering food. With a system entirely focused on this set of problems, we are designing an
online platform that solves all of these problems. For the restaurant, it involves listing their menu, accepting orders
online, online invoices, and billing. For the customer, it involves viewing seating availability, viewing the menu,
ordering food, and online payment.
